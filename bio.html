    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>I grew up in Georgia until the age of about 8, then I moved with my family to, first, Wyoming
            then after 6 months, to Washington state. There, my family stayed for about 4 years. After that,
            we moved back to Georgia, that way we could be closer to family.
        </p>
    <h3>High School/Post High School</h3>
        <p>I went all 4 years to Bleckley County High School, then because of COVID, I left to serve a
            mission in Utah for 3 months, before making it to my original assignment of Guatemala, 
            where I spent the next 20 months.</p>
    <h3>Post Mission</h3>
        <p>After the mission, I went and sold Pest Control door to door in Orange County California
            I did that job from May to mid August. It was a lot harder than I thought it would be!
            I went home to my family in August, then in Early September, my Mom and I drove 29 hours
            non stop to Utah, where I currently am.
